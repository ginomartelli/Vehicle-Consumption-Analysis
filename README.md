# Linear Regression Analysis

## Project Description
Statistical modeling of car fuel efficiency (mpg) using the mtcars dataset to understand relationships between vehicle characteristics and consumption.

- **Data Preparation**: Created unique subset from mtcars with mpg as target and 7 explanatory variables
- **Model Implementation**: Built simple and multiple linear regression from scratch using matrix formulas
- **Variable Selection**: Used adjusted R² to identify most impactful predictors
- **Validation**: Tested assumptions (normality of residuals) and prediction accuracy

## Key Results
- **Best predictors**: Horsepower (hp), Cylinders (cyl), Weight (wt)
- **Model performance**: R² = 0.80 with optimal variable combination
- **Prediction accuracy**: Low mean absolute error on test data
- **Assumptions validated**: Residuals follow normal distribution

Successfully modeled car fuel efficiency using linear regression. The analysis identified key factors affecting mpg and demonstrated that simpler models with carefully selected variables can achieve strong predictive performance.
